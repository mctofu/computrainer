# computrainer

This prototype package supports controlling a CompuTrainer cycle trainer from go code. It is exposed via a gRPC interface/server by [sport-grpc](https://github.com/mctofu/sport-grpc) which allows remote control of the CompuTrainer. I've used this to Wi-Fi enable my CompuTrainer by connecting it to a raspberry pi.
